# Hey, I'm Braden 👋

I'm a Data Science student at UVA building at the intersection of product and engineering. Currently working as a Product Manager Intern at **Token Metrics**, where I'm designing mobile-first experiences that make crypto yield investing accessible to everyone.

I lead a 13-person engineering team through **Project Code**, building a roommate-matching platform that serves 200+ UVA students. I love turning customer insights into products people actually want to use, such as discovering that 2/3 of users are on mobile and 75% of users needed multi-vault allocation functionality, which completely changed our product roadmap.

On the technical side, I've built everything from market intelligence tools during my internship at Titan America to FastAPI applications for mapping federal contracting opportunities. My projects usually involve Python, data pipelines, and finding creative ways to solve real problems with code.

## 🚀 What I'm up to

- Building the "10x differentiator" feature for Token Metrics' V1 mobile app
- Leading engineering at UVA's Project Code Club
- Prepping for Summer 2026 PM internships
